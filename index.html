                <p class="post-content-odd">Bubbles the dumbest cat you will ever have the honor to meet. He is scared of his own poop. We almost got him tested for schizophrenia but we ultimately decided against it. He tries to assert dominance over Kanel every day but is really bad at doing so.</p>

                <p class="post-content-even">Kanel is pretty smart and will use his evil brain to steal food from his parents. He knows how to open and dig in the trashcan and knows how to open doors. He also is a very unclean cat as he often runs around with poop on his paws. He goes absolutely berserk when food is involved and is willing to fight God for a piece of raw chicken.</p>
